# PokeClone
a text based clone of Pokemon that i am programming in python

# Bugs
currently I am in very early development, so much so that the only bugs i've encountered so far are:
  * printing the health of the enemy and the player twice -- idk why it is doing this
  * the player can't die although i should point out that his health can go down, ig it's just not picking up on when the players health is less than or equal to 0
